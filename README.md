## About Cuckoo. 

This is a blockchain application. 

Any resource stored in Cuckoo, including text, images, sounds, videos and website code, will generate an unique address after hashing. Now you can open them just by this address. And this address can be shared. 

Because of the protection of the encryption algorithm, the address has the characteristics of being tamper-resistant and cannot be deleted (in a sense, if the password is cracked, it may be tampered with or deleted, but the probability is extremely low). So, once the data is stored in Cuckoo, it will be permanent. 

For example, we often encounter a resource inaccessible. This situation will not happen on Cuckoo. The more distributed networks a storage site has, the stronger its reliability. 

In Cuckoo, we record, share and deliver every important moment in this way. You will find yourself flying like a cuckoo in a free world. 

At present, the first edition only supports video sharing. Later, it will gradually enrich audio, text and other content.
